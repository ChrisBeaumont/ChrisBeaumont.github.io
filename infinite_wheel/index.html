        <p>
          I recently set up a <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/"> RetroPie</a>. After revisiting some of the standard NES highlights from my childhood (Super Mario 3! Legend of Zelda! Mega Man 6!), I started to explore some of the more obscure NES titles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of them are pretty bad. A good rule of thumb seems to be that if you cherished a particular movie in the late 80s or early 90s, it exists as a terrible Mario or Zelda knockoff on the NES.
        </p>

        <img width="700" title="If you are among the 70% of Rotten Tomatoes critics who don't think Hook should be on a list of cherished 90s movies, you can stop reading now. I have nothing to say to you." src="bad_games.png"/>

        <p>
          However, the Wheel of Fortune game was fun enough that I kept coming back to it.
        </p>
        <img width="700" src="wheel.png"/>
        <p>
          In many ways Wheel of Fortune is a great game for the NES, since
          the gameplay doesn't need complicated graphics or a controller with more than 2 buttons. Unfortunately I was soon reminded that puzzle games on old systems have a crippling flaw &mdash; not enough puzzles! After playing the game a handful of times,
          repeats started showing up. Something had to be done about that. Repeat puzzles are no way to play the Wheel.
        </p>

        <p>
          My general strategy was to figure out how puzzles are stored on the Wheel of Fortune ROM file, and overwrite the program with fresh puzzle data (note that this is both a metaprogramming problem and a metapuzzle problem. Fantastic).
          I started by looking for
          one of the puzzles I remembered &mdash; <span class="clue">Total Eclipse of the Sun</span>&mdash; in the ROM. Fortunately the clues are stored in (mostly) ascii text in a contiguous block, so
          grepping the hexdump worked fine:
        </p>

        <div class="snippet">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeaumont/c35102cb0f0215c9625d.js"></script>
        </div>

        <p>
          That <span class="clue"> TOTA.ECLIPSE O.THE S..</span> looked awfully promising. But what was going on with the non-ascii characters (which hexdump shows as periods) in place of L, F, U, and N? I dubbed this not-quite-ascii encoding <span class="clue">wheelscii</span>. My first thought was that <span class="clue">wheelscii</span> happened to use different byte codes for certian letters like U. However I quickly ruled that out, since L is associated both with its ascii byte and a nonstandard byte inside <span class="clue">TOTAL ECLIPSE</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's actually a simple relationship between the mangled characters
          and their ascii-counterparts. The hex value for the mangled L is  <span class="clue">0xcc</span>, which is the normal ascii value (<span class="clue">0x4c</span>) with the highest bit flipped on. All the mangled characters in <span class="clue">wheelscii</span> are like this &mdash; they're probably signaling something.
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out that they're signaling two things. Each clue ends with two consecutive signal bytes, so they delimit clue boundaries. The signal characters <em>inside</em> a clue delimit line breaks when the puzzle is drawn to the screen. We now have enough information to decode all of the <span class="clue">wheelscii</span> on the ROM:
        </p>

        <div class="snippet">
         <script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeaumont/4f96f5ea0d256665bb00.js"></script>
       </div>

       <p>
        There are 1002 puzzles in total, organized by category (the first 166 puzzles are places, then 202 people, 158 things, etc.). I was surprised by
        the number 1000 &mdash; that was bigger than I assumed, given how quickly I started to see duplicates. Then I realized that I was misled by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday Paradox</a>; people tend to underestimate how likely collisions are when sampling
        with replacement (the original form of the paradox asks how many people you need to put in a room before there's a greater than 50% chance of
        two people sharing a birthday. Many people assume it's over 100. The answer is 23). Sure enough, if you apply the birthday paradox math to
        the case of encountering a duplicate when randomly sampling from 1000 puzzles, you start to expect collisions after 38 puzzles. Or, since each game plays through 4 puzzles, about 10 games. That number is entirely consistent with my experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The birthday paradox was cruel to games on early systems that depended
        on shipping a set of puzzles with the cartridge; typical NES games
        had roughly 512KB of space for storing game data, and that just isn't
        enough to prevent repeat puzzles from being noticeable. Wheel of Fortune 2 tried to deal with this by allowing players to skip puzzles if it looked
        like they'd seen them before. But Wheel of Fortune 1 is way better, and I was determined to fix it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back to the original goal. I now knew how puzzles were stored
        in the game, and I was free to put whatever bytes I wanted in their
        place. The first requirement was a <span class="clue">wheelscii</span> encoder:
      </p>


      <div class="snippet">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeaumont/f1e52b253b24f9b38645.js"></script>
      </div>

      <p>
        As a first experiment, I changed all the letters in the original
        clues to "X", to confirm that the game was reading this data as
        I expected. Success!
      </p>

      <img src="all_x_optimize.gif"/>

      <p>
        Did you notice the display overflow when reporting the number of X's on the board? It's probably the case that the game has a sprite for each digit and, adjacent to that, for the letters A-Z. Each time it "counts" an occurance it shows the sprite at the next memory location, so the next
        "digit" after 9 is A (it's not counting in hexadecimal -- the digit after F is G).
      </p>

      <p>
        Overwriting clues with random letters makes the computer look like a genius. Carole figured out <span class="clue">ZNQQU PLMVJNJEQ</span> way before I did.
      </p>

      <img src="random.gif"/>

      <p>
        It's also fun to see how the game reacts to bad data. Like what
        about clues with only punctuation?
      </p>

      <img src="all_quote_optimize.gif"/>

      <p>
        This triggers some logic within the game that concludes that,
        since there are no remaining consonants to guess, it should skip
        to the endgame scenario where only vowels are left. It then detects
        that nobody has any money to buy vowels, and restarts with a new
        puzzle. This continues forever. If David Lynch made a movie about Wheel of Fortune, this is how it would end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other kinds of corrupt data (like too many letters per line,
        or too many lines) cause the game to freeze at boot-time. There's
        probably some puzzle-preprocessing that happens when the game first
        loads, and I suspect this type of data overflows some fixed-size
        buffer during preprocessing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways, the task now becomes loading a fresh set of (real) clues onto
        the game. Why not use clues from the actual show? The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wheeloffortunepuzzlecompendium/home/compendium">Wheel of Fortune Puzzle Compendium</a> has a list of roughly 20,000 historical puzzles that make a good dataset. I tend to use <a href="https://github.com/chrisbeaumont/soupy">Soupy</a>
        for scraping tasks like this:
      </p>

      <div class="snippet">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisBeaumont/c643d97237022a009041.js"></script>
      </div>

      <p>
        The only real remaining problem is to decide how to insert new
        clues into the game. This requires a bit of finesse, considering
        the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          There's almost certainly a lookup table in the game logic that
          gives the memory address of the first puzzle in each category (otherwise how would the game determine which category a clue belongs
          to?). That suggests that each category of new puzzles should occupy the same number of bytes as the old puzzles.
        </li>
        <li>
          There <em>might</em> be a lookup table that lists the memory
          offset for each puzzle. This seems considerably less likely
          since the signal bytes in <span class="clue">wheelscii</span> make it easy to determine
          puzzle boundaries (and that lookup table would use up too much
          program memory). The puzzle selection algorithm probably just
          jumps to a random byte address in the puzzle bank, steps
          forwards or backwards to a puzzle boundary, and uses that. However,
          the careful reader will note that such a strategy doesn't yield a truly random distribution of puzzles (selection probability is
          proportional to puzzle length for that algorithm).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>

        In the end I decided to be paranoid and ensure that each new puzzle
        has the same category and number of characters as the old puzzle. I packaged all of this into a script that samples 1000 new puzzles from
        the expanded puzzle set and writes a new ROM.
      </p>

      <p>
        One final task remains. I have the ability to "refresh" the ROM
        by swapping in 1000 new puzzles on demand. Why not do that each
        time I play the game? RetroPie lets you customize the emulator startup command on a per-game basis, so I use this startup script when launching Wheel of Fortune.
      </p>

      </div>


      <p>
        The <em>real</em> way to defeat the birthday paradox is to sample puzzles
        without replacement &mdash; even the original set of 1000 puzzles is plenty big enough if collisions were forbidden. That's trickier to pull off; you'd somehow have to track which puzzles the game chooses, which would involve deeper hacking to both the game and (probably) the emulator. That's all a topic for another time. The Wheel beckons.
